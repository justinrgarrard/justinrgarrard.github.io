## Contents

**[U.S. Educational Data: Unification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project)**
* [Data Pipeline](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/USEduData)

> An attempt to bring many different data sources together into one accessible place. A fairly involved data munging project that was well-received on Kaggle.

**[U.S. Educational Finances for Elementary and Secondary Schools](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-finances)**
* [Tableau Tool](https://public.tableau.com/views/U_S_EducationalFinances/U_S_EducationFinancesToolbox?:embed=y&:display_count=yes) for State Edu Financial History

> A large set of U.S. Census Bureau data that includes information on the revenues and expenditures of every school district in the United States. 

**[U.S. College Scorecard Data](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-college-scorecard-data-19962015)**
* [R Markdown Exploration](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/CollegeScorecardAnalysis): 2015 Trends

> A useful but confusingly labelled set of data from the Department of Education. A good practice project for data exploration. 

**[U.S. Educational Attainment](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-attainment-19952015)**
* [R Markdown Exploration](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/EducationalAttainment)

> Somewhat sparse data for three years (1995, 2005, 2015) on educational attainment. Displays some very interesting trends, particularly with regards to women's education rates.
