## Overview

I decided to do a project a little further out of my comfort zone. The custom Magic Mirror was mainly a hardware project, invovling saws and lumber more than code. The end product was a varnished pine wood frame holding a two-way mirror, a computer monitor, and a Raspberry Pi.

> I wanted to write my own approach instead of using one of the popular pre-builts. It matched with the DIY vibe, and was a good oppurtunity to brush up on HTML/CSS/JS.  


## Reflections

I only had a loose idea of how I was going to piece everything together. My background with woodshop began and ended with a class I took in the 8th grade, so some expertise related problems were inevitable. I made bad miter cuts, I split wood with too-long nails, and I did irrevocable damage to my dining room table. The end result was nice enough to forgive the trouble though.
