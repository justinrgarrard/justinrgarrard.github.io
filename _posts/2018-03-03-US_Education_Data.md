## Overview

Education has always been a passion of mine, from pedagogical techniques to new advances in distribution (like Khan Academy). It also makes for excellent data science practice.

This page has links to the various side projects I've done with education data. It includes examples of data collection, munging, exploration, and visualization.


## Contents

[U.S. Educational Finances for Elementary and Secondary Schools](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-finances)
* [Tableau Tool](https://public.tableau.com/views/U_S_EducationalFinances/U_S_EducationFinancesToolbox?:embed=y&:display_count=yes) for State Edu Financial History

> A large set of U.S. Census Bureau data that includes information on the revenues and expenditures of **every school district in the United States**, for more than twenty years. I used Pandas to automate the collection of each year's CSV file into a single file.


[U.S. College Scorecard Data](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-college-scorecard-data-19962015)
* [R Markdown Exploration](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/CollegeScorecardAnalysis): 2015 Trends
* [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/NanodegreeDataVisProjectII/For-ProfitUniversityConcerns?:embed=y&:display_count=yes): For-Profit University Concerns

> A useful but confusingly labelled set of data from the Department of Education. A good practice project for data exploration. This was my submission for two of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree projects (where the choice in data set was left up to the student).

[U.S. Educational Attainment](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-attainment-19952015)
* [R Markdown Exploration](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/EducationalAttainment)

> Somewhat sparse data for three years (1995, 2005, 2015) on educational attainment. Displays some very interesting trends, particularly with regards to women's education rates.
