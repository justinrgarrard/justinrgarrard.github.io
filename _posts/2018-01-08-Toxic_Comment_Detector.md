## Contents

[Code Repository](https://github.com/justinrgarrard/KaggleToxicComment)
* [Wikipedia Logs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge): The provided data for the competition, consisting of labelled Wikipedia comment data.
* [YouTube Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube): A supplemental chunk of data from YouTube comments. 


## Highlights

* An organized machine learning project that generates several features and tests their efficacy in several models. 

* Placed an emphasis on Natural Language Processing tools, such as tokenizers, sentiment analysis, and specialized stemming for an internet comment context.

* Utilized a systematic cross validation approach to tune hyperparameters, optimize feature selection, and display the resulting selections in an easy-to-read manner.

* Allowed for the inclusion of external data sources. I labelled a collection of YouTube comments published in a different data set.
