## Overview

As a matter of personal interest, I aggregated data from two decades of U.S. Census records on educational attainment. The result was a fairly lightweight spreadsheet that broke up demographics along the lines of age, sex, and survey year. A little probing revealed a few interesting trends in education rates.

## The Data

[U.S. Educational Attainment](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-attainment-19952015): The United States Census Bureau conducts regular surveys to assess education levels in the U.S. These surveys sample participants' highest levels of education (i.e. high school diploma, bachelor's degree, etc.) The attached CSV file aggregates data for the years 1995, 2005, and 2015.

## The Highlights

* From 1995 to 2015, there has been significant growth in U.S. education levels among adults ages 25-44.

* This growth has been primarily focused on women. Fifty percent of women between the ages of 22-44 had some form of degree (Associates, Bachelors, or advanced) by 2015, compared to forty percent of men for the same age range.

* High school dropout rates and the percentage of the population with an Associate's degree appear unchanged.
