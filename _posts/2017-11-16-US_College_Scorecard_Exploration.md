## Overview

As part of Udacity's Data Analyst program, students are required to find, explore, and visualize a dataset. I chose to investigate the U.S. College Scorecard data using RStudio and Tableau. The RStudio exploration focused on 2014-2015 data, while the Tableau Story examined For-Profit university behavior from 1996-2015.

## The Data

[U.S. College Scorecard](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-college-scorecard-data-19962015): The College Scorecard was created by the U.S. Department of Education in an attempt to better understand the efficacy of colleges in the United States. The Scorecard reports information such as the cost of tuition, undergraduate enrollment size, and the rate of graduation. 

## The Highlights

* There appears to be a relationship between tution and graduation rates. More specifically, schools with higher tuition tend to have higher five-year graduation rates. This trend is more distinct when schools are grouped by their funding type (private, public, for-profit).

* For-Profit universities demonstrate significantly higher levels of debt and lower five-year graduation rates than other universities.
